## About Tata Motors

Tata Motors is an Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Mumbai, India. As a part of the Tata Group conglomerate, it has grown to become one of India's largest automobile manufacturers and has expanded globally through acquisitions and partnerships.

## Generations

### Early Years (1945-1990s)

Tata Motors began as Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO) in 1945, initially manufacturing locomotives and engineering products. The company's first commercial vehicle, the Tata 1210 truck, was launched in 1954 through a collaboration with Daimler-Benz. During this period, Tata established itself as a significant player in India's commercial vehicle market, expanding its manufacturing facilities and developing indigenous engineering capabilities.

### Passenger Vehicle Entry and Expansion (1990s-2007)

In 1991, Tata Motors launched its first passenger vehicle, the Tata Sierra, a three-door SUV, followed by the Tata Estate (station wagon) and the Tata Sumo (multi-utility vehicle). The landmark Tata Indica, launched in 1998, was India's first indigenously designed and manufactured passenger car. This period saw Tata Motors establishing itself as a full-range automotive manufacturer in India.

### Global Expansion and Acquisitions (2008-2014)

In 2008, Tata Motors made headlines by acquiring the prestigious Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) brands from Ford Motor Company, instantly giving it a global luxury vehicle presence. This period also saw the launch of the Tata Nano in 2009, marketed as the world's most affordable car. During this era, Tata Motors restructured its operations to manage both mass-market and luxury vehicle segments while expanding its international footprint.

### Modern Era and Electrification (2015-present)

Recent years have seen Tata Motors focusing on design improvements, new product lines, and a strong push toward electric mobility. The company launched Tata Nexon EV in 2020, which quickly became India's bestselling electric vehicle. Through its "New Forever" range of vehicles and IMPACT design philosophy, Tata has revitalized its passenger vehicle portfolio with models like the Altroz, Harrier, and Safari. The company has established Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd for its electric vehicle business and plans to launch multiple EVs by 2025 under its Tata.ev brand.
